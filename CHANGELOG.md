## Finding the diameter of an image within MATLAB

Editor: J. Coburn

## [Unreleased]

### [0.0.0] -2024-11-13
### Added
- Finding an image that I would like to be displayed in my code.
- The image I wanted to display and find the diameter of in MATLAB was the logo for the Kansas Jayhawks.
- In order to be capable of displaying this image I made it a JPEG or JPG file.
- Initially my code wouldn't run when I first formulated this project because even though I had user functions present, I didn't have anything to call these functions.
