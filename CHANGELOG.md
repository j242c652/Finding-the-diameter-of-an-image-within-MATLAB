## Finding the diameter of an image within MATLAB

Editor: J. Coburn

## [Unreleased]

### [0.0.0] -2024-11-13
### Added
- Finding an image that I would like to be displayed in my code.
- The image I wanted to display and find the diameter of in MATLAB was the logo for the Kansas Jayhawks.
- In order to be capable of displaying this image I made it a JPEG or JPG file.
- Initially my code wouldn't run when I first formulated this project because even though I had user functions present, I didn't have anything to call these functions.
### [0.1.1] -2024-12-11
- One component of trying to get my code to run and displaying the image was requesting calibatrion input.
- MATLAB wanted me to use a diameter and find the number of pixels within the image I wanted to use in order for it to be displayed.
- I had no set diameter or number of pixels for the image so I put the calibration input = to 1.
- After I made this change the JPG image of the Kansas Jayhawks logo I wanted was displayed once I added ran the code and added the file that was required in order for the code to run.
### [0.1.2] -2024-12-11
- Another important part of my project when running the code on MATLAB was requesting region of interest (ROI) selection from the user. I was able to pick an area from the image I was displaying through the code that was being ran, the region I selected was the picture of the Jayhawk, which is highlighted in a large blue rectangle.
